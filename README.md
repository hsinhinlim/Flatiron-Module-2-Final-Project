# Flatiron Module 2 Final Project

## Objective
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

## Approach
My approach to the problem was as follows:
1) Determine metrics for what "doing well at the box office means" - these are the metrics of Net Gross and Return on Investment(ROI)
2) Divide up films into different budget categories and by their popularity to test these metrics of profitability against these different categories
3) Whether films that did well by Net Gross were the same films that did well by ROI and if not, what characteristics did they have?
4) Find out what films were both popular and successful (from both an ROI and Net Gross measure)
5) Who the writers and directors were who worked on popular films that were commercially successful (from both an ROI and Net Gross measure)
6) Which genre of films are commercially successful and therefore worth making (from both an ROI and Net Gross perspective)
7) Given that the new studio can only make a set amount of films to begin with, what mix of films (by budget category) should they be looking to make

## Contents
This repository contains:
1) a Jupyter Notebook (Student.ipynb) which contains the EDA and actual analysis undertaken to reach certain conclusions and recommendations
2) a zipped file containing 9 csv files and 2 tsv files - all of which are required to be **unzipped in the same directory** as the Jupyter Notebook to work. Please note not all the data in these files were used for analysis, some of the data was discarded in the process of the EDA. 
3) a pdf of a slide presentation (presentation.pdf), setting out the conclusions and recommendations to a non-technical audience.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook
