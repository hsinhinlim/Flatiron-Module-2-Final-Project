# Flatiron Module 2 Final Project

## Objective
To apply multivariate linear regression on a dataset of residential properties (and their prices) located in King County, Washington

## Approach

## Contents
This repository contains:
1) a Jupyter Notebook (student.ipynb) which contains the EDA and actual analysis undertaken to reach certain conclusions and recommendations;
2) a pdf of a slide presentation (presentation.pdf), setting out the conclusions and recommendations to a non-technical audience;
3) the dataset of King County housing data (kc_house_data.csv); and
4) a geojson file (zip_codes.geojson) setting out the polygon shapes of various King County zipcodes which are in the dataset. This is used to draw the choropleth map in the Jupyter notebook

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook

There is a YouTube video of a non-technical walkthrough of the slide presentation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK5ThKrqTtg
