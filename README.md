# Flatiron Module 2 Final Project

## Objective
King County Dataset

## Approach

## Contents
This repository contains:
1) a Jupyter Notebook (Student.ipynb) which contains the EDA and actual analysis undertaken to reach certain conclusions and recommendations
2) a zipped file containing 9 csv files and 2 tsv files - all of which are required to be **unzipped in the same directory** as the Jupyter Notebook to work. Please note not all the data in these files were used for analysis, some of the data was discarded in the process of the EDA. 
3) a pdf of a slide presentation (presentation.pdf), setting out the conclusions and recommendations to a non-technical audience.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook

## Other materials
I blogged about this project here: 
There is a YouTube video of a non-technical walkthrough of the slide presentation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK5ThKrqTtg
